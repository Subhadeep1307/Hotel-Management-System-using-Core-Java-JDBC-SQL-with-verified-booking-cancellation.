Hotel Management System
Technologies: Core Java, JDBC, SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
Developed a console-based Hotel Management System using Core Java and JDBC following a layered architecture (Model, DAO, Service).
Designed and implemented database schemas to manage rooms, customers, bookings, and payments efficiently.
Implemented core functionalities such as room availability checking, customer registration, booking creation, booking cancellation, and billing.
Used JDBC for secure and efficient interaction with the relational database, including CRUD operations.
Applied OOP principles (encapsulation, abstraction) to ensure clean, modular, and maintainable code.
Focused on data integrity, validation, and exception handling to simulate real-world hotel operations.
Structured the project to be scalable and GitHub-ready, allowing future enhancements like UI or web integration.
